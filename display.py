def clear_screen():
    """
    Adds vertical space to the console output by printing multiple newline characters.

    This function prints 10 newline characters to the standard output, effectively pushing
    the existing console content upward. It serves as a basic method to create separation
    between different sections of output or to simulate clearing the screen.

    Note:
    - This approach does not truly clear the console; it only adds vertical space.
    - The effectiveness may vary depending on the size of the console window and the
      amount of content already present.
