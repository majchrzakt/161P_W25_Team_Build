def choose_path():
    """
    Presents the player with a crossroads scenario and prompts them to choose a direction.

    This function clears the screen, describes the current situation where the player is at a
    crossroads, and offers four directional choices: left, right, straight ahead, or back. Based
    on the player's input, it returns the corresponding path identifier.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the chosen path, which can be:
             - 'forest' for the left path
             - 'cave' for the right path
             - 'mountain' for going straight ahead
             - 'town' for turning back
             If the input doesn't match any valid choice, an empty string is returned.

    Behavior:
    - Clears the console screen using the `clear_screen` function.
    - Displays a narrative indicating the player is at a crossroads with four possible directions.
    - Defines valid choices as: 'left', 'right', 'straight', 'ahead', 'back'.
    - Calls the `get_valid_choice` function with the valid choices to obtain and validate the
      player's input.
    - Maps the player's choice to a corresponding path identifier:
        - 'left'  -> 'forest'
        - 'right' -> 'cave'
        - 'straight' or 'ahead' -> 'mountain'
        - 'back'  -> 'town'
    - Returns the path identifier based on the player's choice. If the choice doesn't match any
      valid options, returns an empty string.

    Note:
    - The `clear_screen` function is expected to clear the console output to provide a fresh
      interface for the player.
    - The `get_valid_choice` function should handle user input, ensure it's one of the valid
      choices, and return the validated choice.

    Example:
        >>> path = choose_path()
        (Screen is cleared)
        You find yourself at a crossroads.
        Do you want to go left, right, straight ahead, or turn back?
        > left
        >>> print(path)
        forest

    In this example, the player chooses to go 'left', and the function returns 'forest' as the
    corresponding path identifier.
